"""D3b/D3c regression test: circuit-state checkpoint restore + lazy baselines.

dbsp_save() snapshots operator state (aggregate groups, private join
indexes) and sink results; dbsp_load() cold-creates covered views (no
circuit replay) and injects that state. With D3c, a watermark-matched
restore also DEFERS tracked-table baselines and shared-arrangement
backfill: dbsp_load reads zero source rows; the first operation that
needs table state (notify delta, pre-write hook, replay) materializes
them from a single typed scan.

Proven here:
  1. post-restore incremental edits are CORRECT (internal aggregate state
     restored; deferred baselines materialize with pending-delta
     subtraction before the first notify delta propagates),
  2. restore is much faster than rebuild and defers all sources,
  3. a stale checkpoint (source changed after save) is detected via
     watermarks at load and falls back to a full rebuild,
  4. auto-sync SQL writes after a lazy restore stay exact (QueryBegin
     materializes deferred baselines from pre-write storage),
  5. an out-of-band write against a deferred baseline (auto-sync off, no
     notify) is detected at the next sync and self-heals via a full view
     rebuild at the next statement boundary.
