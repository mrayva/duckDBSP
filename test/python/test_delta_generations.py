"""Regression test: dbsp_delta_generations() stamps each view's delta buffer
with the commit generation that wrote it.

dbsp_changes is a single-generation buffer that reading does NOT drain — an
untouched view keeps serving its last delta (its initial replay, at worst)
forever. A change-feed consumer must therefore compare each view's generation
against a baseline and skip views whose buffer predates the commits it cares
about. This test pins that contract.

Run: python test_delta_generations.py <path-to-dbsp.duckdb_extension>
