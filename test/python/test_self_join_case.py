"""CASE + later column refs silently wrong (regression).

Found 2026-08-14 by NumPad's MV compiler as "CASE across a self-join
(same table LEFT-JOINed twice) is silently NULL/wrong". Root cause is NOT
self-join-specific: BatchEvaluator reused each expression's result vector
across execute() calls. DuckDB's CASE executor has all-one-branch fast
paths that make the result vector a REFERENCE to an input chunk column;
on a later batch with mixed branches, FillSwitch writes through that
stale pointer straight into the shared input chunk, corrupting the
branch's source column for every expression evaluated AFTER the CASE in
that batch. The self-join shape merely produced the required batch
sequence (an all-one-branch batch, then a mixed batch) during CREATE.

This test compares dbsp_query() output against stock DuckDB running the
same SELECT, covering the originally reported self-join shape plus the
staged-commit single-table and distinct-table shapes that trigger the
same mechanism. Silent divergence == FAIL.

Run: python test_self_join_case.py <path-to-dbsp.duckdb_extension>
