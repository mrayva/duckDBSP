"""Multi-table commit = ONE circuit pass (regression).

A transaction writing SEVERAL tracked tables used to propagate once per
table at COMMIT; each pass rewrote every downstream view's single-generation
dbsp_changes buffer, so a view reading BOTH tables kept only the last
table's effects, and a join both of whose sides changed missed its
both-shared correction. sync_tables now collects every table's delta and
runs one propagate_changes_multi pass.

Run: python test_multi_table_commit.py <path-to-dbsp.duckdb_extension>
