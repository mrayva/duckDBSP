"""NTH_VALUE frame semantics (regression).

NTH_VALUE(x, n) returns the nth row OF THE FRAME — default frame RANGE
UNBOUNDED PRECEDING..CURRENT ROW, so rows before the nth are NULL. The
old implementation indexed the whole partition (partition_rows[n-1]) for
every row: early rows wrongly saw the value, and explicit ROWS frames
were ignored entirely. Truth = DuckDB's own window executor on the same
data.

Run: python test_nth_value_frames.py <path-to-dbsp.duckdb_extension>
