# Testing Guide

How duckDBSP is tested, how to run the suites, and what each layer
covers. The single most important idea: **differential testing** —
after every batch of changes, an incrementally maintained view must
equal DuckDB's own answer for the same SQL. DuckDB is the oracle; the
engine never gets to grade its own homework.

## Running the suites

For the pinned DuckDB release build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DDUCKDB_SOURCE_DIR="$PWD/duckdb"
cmake --build build -j8
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
build/test/test_planner_frontend # the big differential suite on its own
```

### DuckDB tip port

Tip builds use the current DuckDB source tree and an explicit compatibility
mode:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-tip \
  -DDUCKDB_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/duckdb \
  -DDBSP_TIP_PORT=ON \
  -DDBSP_ENGINE_HOOK=OFF
cmake --build build-tip -j4
ctest --test-dir build-tip --output-on-failure -j1 --timeout 120
```

The supported tip baseline is the CTest suite plus the planner, CDC, and
recursive integration suites. The validated baseline is 36/36 CTest tests
passing and 88/88 planner cases passing. Legacy tests that directly require
the removed write-capture, optimizer plan-tee, or engine-hook APIs are
excluded in tip mode; this is an intentional compatibility boundary, not a
silent pass.

Tip mode uses scan-and-diff for UPDATE/DELETE paths whose old write-capture
API is unavailable. Holistic aggregate values remain in memory on tip while
table, join, and top-K spill paths remain enabled and tested.

Benchmarks and the soak test build alongside but are not part of ctest:

```bash
make bench_planner_eval soak_differential
./bench_planner_eval                        # throughput + RAM benches
SOAK_ROUNDS=60 ./soak_differential "[soak]" # randomized long-run churn
```

Sanitizer builds live in sibling directories with the same CMake setup:

```bash
cd test/build_asan   # RelWithDebInfo + AddressSanitizer
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 ./test_planner_frontend
# (leak detection off: the CDC manager is a deliberately leaked singleton)

cd test/build_tsan   # ThreadSanitizer
./test_planner_frontend "[parallel],[spill],[shard]"
./test_thread_safety
```

## The layers

### 1. Unit tests (`test/unit/`)

Direct exercises of one component: Z-set algebra and the dense
FlatWeightMap (including property tests against an oracle map with
hostile hash functions), the spill store (row codec round-trips,
rebuild diffs, bucket-index property tests across compactions), native
view classes, CDC manager locking, security validation.

### 2. Integration tests (`test/integration/`)

Everything through the real extension surface: table functions, CDC,
cascades, recovery, persistence, ACID behavior. The centerpiece is
`test_planner_frontend.cpp` — for every supported SQL shape it creates
a view, runs randomized insert/delete rounds (NULLs included by the
generators), and after each round compares the view's contents against
DuckDB executing the same SQL directly:

```
expected:  SELECT * FROM (<view SQL>) ORDER BY ALL     -- DuckDB itself
actual:    SELECT * FROM dbsp_query('<view>') ORDER BY ALL
```

Coverage includes joins of all types, correlated subqueries, grouping
sets, ordered and holistic aggregates, window functions over
expressions, percentage limits, spill-mode variants (bounded top-K
with forced refills, spilled arrangements with live migration), and
parallel propagation.

### 3. Soak test (`test/benchmarks/soak_differential.cpp`)

Stacked views (outer join → aggregate → sort, NOT IN, recursive)
under hundreds of randomized delete-heavy rounds, differentially
checked every round. `SOAK_ROUNDS` scales the run.

### 4. Sanitizers

ASAN and TSAN builds run the same suites. TSAN specifically pins the
concurrency claims: parallel view propagation, sharded join probes,
and concurrent probes of one spilled shared arrangement.

### 5. Benchmarks (`test/benchmarks/bench_planner_eval.cpp`)

Throughput ledgers (filter/aggregate/join rows-per-second, cascade
sync latency, captured-commit latency), spill-mode RAM/CPU trade
(maxrss comparison), arrangement-sharing and sharded-probe contrasts.
Perf-sensitive changes are gated on these staying inside their noise
bands — regressions here have reverted otherwise-working designs.

## Conventions

- Tests encode intent, not just behavior: when a formerly rejected SQL
  construct becomes supported, the test asserting the rejection is
  updated to assert the support (and this shows up in the commit).
- Randomized generators always include NULLs and duplicate values.
- New state machinery ships with a property test against a plain
  in-memory oracle (see `test_zset.cpp`, `test_spill_store.cpp`).
- Bench numbers quoted in commits come from `build` (release
  flags); sanitizer-build numbers are 20-30x slower and never quoted.
