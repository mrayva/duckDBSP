## SQL DDL Syntax

The primary interface. Sources are tracked automatically and views keep
themselves current (auto-sync is on by default).

### CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW name AS SELECT ...;
```

Creates an incrementally maintained view. Equivalent to
`dbsp_create_view('name', 'SELECT ...')`. Internally routed through the
`dbsp_create_materialized_view` table function (registered for the
parser extension; not intended for direct use).

### CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW name AS SELECT ...;
```

Plain `CREATE` when `name` doesn't exist yet; when it does, changes its
definition and rebuilds **only** `name` and its transitive dependents —
equivalent to `dbsp_replace_view('name', 'SELECT ...')`. See
`dbsp_replace_view` below for the rebuild semantics.

### REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW name;
```

Accepted for compatibility — a no-op, since views refresh automatically.

### DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW

DuckDB parses `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` natively, which bypasses the
extension's parser hook — use the function form instead:

```sql
SELECT dbsp_drop('name');           -- or dbsp_drop_cascade('name')
```

---

## Table Tracking

> **Usually unnecessary**: creating a view auto-tracks its source
> tables and loads their current state, and auto-sync (on by default)
> keeps views current on every commit. These functions serve manual
> workflows: pre-tracking, bulk loads with auto-sync off, and the
> notify API.

### dbsp_track(table_name)

Track a DuckDB table for automatic change detection.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_track('orders');
```

**Parameters:**
- `table_name` (VARCHAR): Name of the table to track

**Returns:**
- `result` (VARCHAR): Confirmation message with column count

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (id INT, customer VARCHAR, amount DECIMAL);
SELECT * FROM dbsp_track('orders');
-- Returns: "Tracking table: orders (3 columns)"
```

**Notes:**
- Automatically detects table schema
- Loads current table contents into tracking state
- Required before creating views on the table

---

### dbsp_sync(table_name)

Synchronize a tracked table with its current DuckDB state. Detects and propagates any changes made outside of DBSP notifications.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_sync('orders');
```

**Parameters:**
- `table_name` (VARCHAR, optional): Table to sync. If omitted, syncs all tracked tables.

**Returns:**
- `result` (VARCHAR): Confirmation message

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Sync specific table
SELECT * FROM dbsp_sync('orders');

-- Sync all tracked tables
SELECT * FROM dbsp_sync();
```

**Notes:**
- Use after INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements
- Computes delta between tracked state and actual table
- Propagates changes to all dependent views

---

### dbsp_tables()

List all tables currently being tracked for CDC.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_tables();
```

**Returns:**
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `table_name` | VARCHAR | Name of tracked table |
| `columns` | BIGINT | Number of columns |

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_tables();
-- table_name | columns
-- orders     | 3
-- products   | 5
```

---

## View Management

### dbsp_create_view(name, sql)

Create an incrementally maintained materialized view using SQL syntax.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('view_name', 'SELECT ... FROM ...');
```

**Parameters:**
- `name` (VARCHAR): Unique name for the view
- `sql` (VARCHAR): SQL SELECT statement defining the view

**Returns:**
- `result` (VARCHAR): Confirmation with source tables

**Supported SQL:**
```sql
-- Filter
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('high_value',
    'SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 100');

-- Projection
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('order_amounts',
    'SELECT id, amount FROM orders');

-- Aggregation
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('totals',
    'SELECT customer, SUM(amount) FROM orders GROUP BY customer');

-- Distinct
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('unique_customers',
    'SELECT DISTINCT customer FROM orders');

-- Join
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('order_details',
    'SELECT * FROM orders JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id');

-- Cascading (view on view)
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('vip_totals',
    'SELECT * FROM totals WHERE SUM > 1000');
```

**Notes:**
- Source tables are automatically tracked if not already
- Views can reference other views (cascading)
- Circular dependencies are detected and rejected

---

### dbsp_replace_view(name, sql)

Change an existing materialized view's definition in place, rebuilding
**only** that view and its transitive dependents — everything upstream
(its sources, and any unrelated view) is left untouched, and every
dependent keeps its own original DDL.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_replace_view('view_name', 'SELECT ... FROM ...');
```

Equivalent to `CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...`
(the DDL form routes here automatically when `view_name` already exists).

**Parameters:**
- `name` (VARCHAR): Name of an existing view
- `sql` (VARCHAR): New SQL SELECT statement for the view

**Returns:**
- `result` (VARCHAR): Confirmation with source tables

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('lvl1', 'SELECT k, v * 2 AS d FROM base');
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('lvl2', 'SELECT k, d + 1 AS e FROM lvl1');

-- Redefine lvl1; lvl2's own DDL is untouched, only its values change
SELECT * FROM dbsp_replace_view('lvl1', 'SELECT k, v * 3 AS d FROM base');
```

**Notes:**
- Fails with `DBSP-E206` if `name` doesn't exist — use `dbsp_create_view`
  for a new view instead.
- No transactional rollback (v1): if a dependent fails to recreate mid
  rebuild, the remaining dependents are still attempted with their saved
  DDL, and the `DBSP-E304` error reports every failure plus which views
  are still queryable afterward.
- Cost is proportional to the changed view's subtree — sources and
  sibling views outside it never repopulate.

---

### dbsp_use_planner(enable)

**Deprecated no-op since Phase C5.** The planner frontend is the only
frontend — the bespoke SQL parser it used to toggle against was deleted.
The function stays callable so existing scripts don't break; it always
reports ENABLED. `dbsp_create_view` translates view SQL through DuckDB's
own binder/planner, covering scan/filter/projection (arbitrary
expressions), GROUP BY aggregation (multiple aggregates, expression keys,
HAVING, global aggregates, exact DECIMAL SUM, DISTINCT and FILTER
modifiers, ROLLUP/CUBE/GROUPING SETS with GROUPING(), ordered
STRING_AGG/ARRAY_AGG, holistic MEDIAN/QUANTILE_CONT/QUANTILE_DISC/
MODE/MAD), inner and outer joins (LEFT/RIGHT/FULL, equi + residual
predicates), cross joins, IN/NOT IN/EXISTS/scalar subqueries
(correlated included), DISTINCT, DISTINCT ON, UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT
(ALL and DISTINCT), window functions (expressions auto-projected;
`ROWS`/`RANGE`/`GROUPS` frames including constant bounded frames like
`ROWS BETWEEN 11 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`, `LAG`/`LEAD` with a constant
non-default offset like `LAG(v, 12)`, and `NTILE` with a constant bucket
count like `NTILE(4)`), non-recursive CTEs, WITH RECURSIVE (deletions
included), and ORDER BY/LIMIT/OFFSET (constant or percentage). The few
remaining gaps (USING KEY recursion, expression LIMIT, approximate
statistics like approx_quantile, unordered string_agg, NTH_VALUE's N —
even as a literal constant, unlike NTILE's bucket count — see TODO.md)
fail with a DBSP-E110 error naming the construct.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_use_planner();       -- Always: ENABLED
```

**Parameters:**
- `enable` (BOOLEAN, optional): Enable or disable. Omit to query status.

**Returns:**
- `result` (VARCHAR): Confirmation or current status

---

### dbsp_create_view(name, table, type, spec)

Alternative syntax for simple views without SQL parsing.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('name', 'table', 'type', 'spec');
```

**Parameters:**
- `name` (VARCHAR): View name
- `table` (VARCHAR): Source table
- `type` (VARCHAR): View type (`filter`, `aggregate`, `distinct`)
- `spec` (VARCHAR): Type-specific specification

**Type Specifications:**

| Type | Spec Format | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `filter` | `column op value` | `amount > 100` |
| `aggregate` | `group_col AGG value_col` | `customer SUM amount` |
| `distinct` | (empty string) | `` |

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Filter view
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('expensive', 'orders', 'filter', 'amount > 100');

-- Aggregate view
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('totals', 'orders', 'aggregate', 'customer SUM amount');

-- Distinct view
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('unique', 'orders', 'distinct', '');
```

---

### dbsp_views()

List all materialized views with statistics.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_views();
```

**Returns:**
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `view_name` | VARCHAR | Name of the view |
| `sql` | VARCHAR | SQL definition |
| `rows` | BIGINT | Current row count |
| `version` | BIGINT | Update version number |

For a view still pending lazy restore (see `dbsp_lazy_restore` below),
`rows` is read straight from the checkpoint's stashed sink blob (its
length-prefix, no decode) rather than the view's live state — exact,
since "pending" means no delta has touched it, but this call never
triggers the view's actual restore. `dbsp_views()` enumerates every view,
so realizing here to compute a row count would eagerly decode everything
on the first call, defeating the point of lazy restore.

---

### dbsp_drop(view_name)

Alias: `dbsp_drop_view(view_name)` (identical scalar function).

Drop a materialized view.

```sql
SELECT dbsp_drop('view_name');
```

**Parameters:**
- `view_name` (VARCHAR): Name of view to drop

**Returns:**
- VARCHAR: "Dropped" or error message

**Notes:**
- Fails if other views depend on this view
- Use `dbsp_drop_cascade` to force drop with dependents

---

### dbsp_drop_cascade(view_name)

Alias: `dbsp_drop_view_cascade(view_name)`.

Drop a view and all views that depend on it.

```sql
SELECT dbsp_drop_cascade('view_name');
```

**Parameters:**
- `view_name` (VARCHAR): Name of view to drop

**Returns:**
- VARCHAR: Confirmation with count of dropped views

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT dbsp_drop_cascade('totals');
-- Returns: "Dropped totals (and 2 dependent views)"
```

---

### dbsp_deps(view_name)

Show dependencies for a view.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_deps('view_name');
```

**Returns:**
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `name` | VARCHAR | Related view/table name |
| `relationship` | VARCHAR | `depends_on` or `depended_by` |

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_deps('vip_totals');
-- name    | relationship
-- totals  | depends_on
-- orders  | depends_on
```

---

## Querying

### dbsp_query(view_name)

Query a materialized view. Returns current contents instantly without recomputation.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_query('view_name');
```

**Parameters:**
- `view_name` (VARCHAR): Name of view to query

**Returns:**
- Table with columns matching the view's schema

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_query('customer_totals');
-- customer | SUM
-- Alice    | 300
-- Bob      | 200
```

**Notes:**
- Results reflect all synced changes
- Query is O(result_size), not O(source_size)
- Column names derived from SQL or auto-generated (col0, col1, ...)

---

### dbsp_changes(view_name)

Rows added or removed by the view's most recent sync, as the view's columns
plus a signed BIGINT `weight` (+n insert, -n delete).

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_changes('customer_totals');
```

**Parameters:**
- `view_name` (VARCHAR): Name of the view

**Returns:**
- The view's columns, plus `weight` (BIGINT)

**Semantics:**
- Single-generation buffer: holds the delta of the most recent sync step
  that touched the view, and is overwritten by the next one — consume
  between syncs.
- While a group survives an aggregate update, the step contains an
  `(old row, -1)`, `(new row, +1)` pair, so one read yields both old and
  new values.
- One `dbsp_notify_insert`/`dbsp_notify_delete` call is one step: a
  delete+insert notify pair leaves only the insert step's delta. Read
  between the two notifies if both halves are needed.
- Empty result when the view exists but no sync has touched it; error when
  the view does not exist.
- Empty right after CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW, even over a populated table:
  the initial-population delta is dropped at create (bounded-RAM Phase 1a)
  — only post-create commits populate the buffer.
- Reading does NOT drain the buffer: an untouched view keeps serving the
  same delta (its create-time initial replay, at worst) until the next sync
  that touches it. Use `dbsp_delta_generations()` to tell fresh buffers
  from stale ones.

---

### dbsp_view_state()

Per-view resident circuit-state bytes, approximated by class.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_view_state();
```

**Returns:**
- `view_name` (VARCHAR) — plus one synthetic row `__shared_arrangements`
  for manager-owned shared join arrangements
- `result_bytes`, `arrangement_bytes`, `window_bytes`, `recursion_bytes`,
  `other_bytes`, `total_bytes` (BIGINT)

**Semantics:**
- Estimates calibrated for trend, not exact heap bytes; H6 payload-shared
  rows are counted once per scan (attribution goes to the first view
  scanned; totals are what reconcile with the process footprint).
- On macOS compare against `footprint(1)`/phys_footprint, not `ps rss` —
  the compressor hides most cold circuit state from RSS (measured: a DAG
  reporting 2.5GB RSS had a 23GB physical footprint).
- `other_bytes` includes per-node output buffers and delta buffers.
- Tracked-table baselines are NOT included — see `dbsp_table_state()`;
  a RAM budget must sum both functions.

---

### dbsp_table_state()

Per-tracked-table baseline residency. Boxed baselines (~300 B/row) are the
dominant big-model RAM class and are invisible to `dbsp_view_state()`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_table_state();
```

**Returns:**
- `table_name` (VARCHAR)
- `mode` (VARCHAR) — `boxed` (full rows in a RAM Z-set), `spilled`
  (disk record log + ~72 B/row digest index), or `deferred` (lazy-restore
  fast path: nothing materialized until first use)

Baselines auto-spill above `DBSP_SPILL_THRESHOLD_ROWS` (default 2,000,000
rows; `0` disables) — including mid-scan during the initial baseline
build, so big tables never pay the boxed peak. Small tables stay boxed
for speed; `dbsp_spill(true)` still force-spills everything.
- `distinct_rows` (BIGINT) — deferred tables report the restore-time
  COUNT(*) upper bound
- `resident_bytes` (BIGINT) — baseline plus pending-changes buffer,
  calibrated estimate

---

### dbsp_delta_generations()

Per-view provenance for the `dbsp_changes` buffer: the commit generation at
which each view's delta buffer was last rewritten.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_delta_generations();
```

**Returns:**
- `view_name` (VARCHAR)
- `generation` (BIGINT): commit sequence at the buffer's last rewrite
  (create-time initial replay or a propagation step); 0 when the buffer was
  never written (e.g. a restored, still-pending view).

**Semantics:**
- Generations only advance when a sync rewrites the view's buffer — reads
  (`dbsp_changes`, `dbsp_query`) never move them.
- Change-feed pattern: snapshot `MAX(generation)` as a baseline after
  setup; after each commit batch, harvest `dbsp_changes` only from views
  whose generation moved past the baseline, then advance the baseline.
  Without the filter, a consumer re-reads stale buffers of untouched views
  on every batch.

---

## Persistence

### dbsp_save()

Save all view definitions to the `_dbsp_views` table in the default
catalog — inside the database file, so copies and backups carry the
views. `dbsp_save('view_name', 'table_name')` saves one view to a named
table (identifier-validated).

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_save();
```

---

### dbsp_save(filepath)

Save all view definitions to a JSON file.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_save('views.json');
```

**Parameters:**
- `filepath` (VARCHAR): Path to output JSON file, relative to the working
  directory (absolute paths and path traversal are rejected)

**Returns:**
- VARCHAR: Confirmation message

**JSON Format:**
```json
{
  "tracked_tables": ["orders", "products"],
  "views": [
    {
      "name": "totals",
      "sql": "SELECT customer, SUM(amount) FROM orders GROUP BY customer",
      "sources": ["orders"],
      "created_at": 1699900000000
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### dbsp_load()

Load view definitions from the `_dbsp_views` table (see `dbsp_save()`).
Missing `_dbsp_views` is not an error — there is simply nothing to load.
`dbsp_load('table_name')` loads from a named table (identifier-validated;
a missing named table IS an error). Loading rebuilds view state from
current table data.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_load();
```

---

### dbsp_load(filepath, 'json')

Load view definitions from a JSON file. The explicit `'json'` format
argument is required — a bare one-argument form is interpreted as a
DuckDB table name, not a file.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_load('views.json', 'json');
```

**Parameters:**
- `filepath` (VARCHAR): Path to JSON file, relative to the working
  directory (absolute paths and path traversal are rejected)
- `format` (VARCHAR): Must be `'json'`

**Notes:**
- Recreates views in creation order (handles dependencies)
- Re-syncs with current table data
- Continues loading if individual views fail

**Returns:**
- VARCHAR: Confirmation with view count

---

## Manual CDC

For cases where `dbsp_sync()` is not suitable, you can manually notify of changes.

### dbsp_notify_insert(table, values...)

Notify DBSP of a row insertion.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_notify_insert('orders', 1, 'Alice', 100.00);
```

**Parameters:**
- `table` (VARCHAR): Table name
- `values...` (ANY): Column values in order

**Returns:**
- VARCHAR: Confirmation message

---

### dbsp_notify_delete(table, values...)

Notify DBSP of a row deletion.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_notify_delete('orders', 1, 'Alice', 100.00);
```

**Parameters:**
- `table` (VARCHAR): Table name
- `values...` (ANY): Column values identifying the row

**Returns:**
- VARCHAR: Confirmation message

---

## Runtime Modes

### dbsp_auto_sync(enable)

Toggle automatic change capture — **ON by default**: views update on
every transaction commit without calling `dbsp_sync`.

Most plain SQL writes commit in **O(delta)** via captured deltas:

- **INSERT** — explicit transactions containing only INSERTs (G2,
  captured from transaction-local storage), and autocommit INSERTs from a
  VALUES list or a deterministic SELECT (evaluated with the INSERT's own
  casts; partial column lists take their declared DEFAULTs; ~1.0 ms at
  1M rows). SELECT sources must be repeatable: no LIMIT/SAMPLE, no table
  functions, no window functions, no CTEs.
- **Upserts** (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (cols) DO UPDATE SET
  excluded.-qualified / DO NOTHING`) — captured via a LEFT JOIN probe of
  committed state; unqualified target columns in SET, conditional
  `DO ... WHERE`, `OR REPLACE`, and implicit conflict targets fall back.
- **UPDATE / DELETE** — explicit-transaction *and* autocommit statements
  (write capture: one internal SELECT reads the old images and computes
  the new ones before the statement runs; a commit guard — interleaved-
  commit check, signed COUNT(*), rowid re-verification — validates the
  captured delta against committed storage). Subquery predicates and
  `DELETE ... USING` (rewritten to a correlated EXISTS probe) capture
  too, when the statement sees pure committed state: autocommit, or an
  explicit transaction before its first write. A single-row UPDATE on a
  1M-row table syncs in ~1.5 ms vs ~2.4 s for scan-and-diff.

- **Any other UPDATE or DELETE** — a plan tee (optimizer extension)
  observes the exact rows the statement processed, covering everything
  the pre-image capture declines: `UPDATE ... FROM`, prepared
  parameters, volatile expressions, post-write subqueries, `USING` over
  transaction-local state, indexed-column UPDATEs, repeated writes to
  one table in a transaction.

Everything else uses scan-and-diff scoped to the tables the transaction
touched: multi-match `UPDATE ... FROM` (two new images for one row —
ambiguous, the tee detects it and steps aside), CTEs/`RETURNING` on
non-teeable shapes,
non-deterministic expressions (`random()`, `now()`), UPDATEs of indexed
or LIST-typed columns, multi-statement strings, and any
transaction that writes the same table twice. If any
statement in a transaction is un-capturable, the whole transaction falls
back — captured and scanned deltas never mix for one commit, and guard
failures fall back loudly (`capture_guard_fallbacks` counter).
Correctness never depends on capture; the design is in
`docs/DESIGN_WRITE_CAPTURE.md`.

**DuckDB tip compatibility:** the write-capture and optimizer plan-tee APIs
used by the release path are not present in current DuckDB tip. In
`DBSP_TIP_PORT` builds, unsupported UPDATE/DELETE shapes therefore use the
correctness-first scan-and-diff path. The public SQL functions and automatic
refresh semantics remain available; O(delta) capture claims above apply to
the pinned release build only.

Turn auto-sync off for bulk loads (each autocommit INSERT pays a scoped
scan) and run one `dbsp_sync()` afterwards.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_auto_sync(true);   -- Enable
SELECT * FROM dbsp_auto_sync(false);  -- Disable
SELECT * FROM dbsp_auto_sync();       -- Query status
```

### dbsp_autopersist(enable)

Toggle auto-persist — **ON by default**: a database that used DBSP views
reopens with them alive, no explicit `dbsp_save()`/`dbsp_load()` calls.

- **Auto-save**: on a clean connection close (the last user connection to
  an instance), if autopersist is on and any view exists, the extension
  saves view definitions (`dbsp_save()`) and a circuit-state checkpoint
  (`save_checkpoint()`) automatically.
- **Auto-load**: the first DBSP entry point that has a `ClientContext`
  (`dbsp_query`, `dbsp_views`, `dbsp_track`, `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`,
  `dbsp_sync`, `dbsp_changes`) loads persisted state — checkpoint fast path
  included — if the view registry in this session is still empty. Fires at
  most once per session and never after a view has already been created
  here; a missing `_dbsp_views` table is not an error (there is simply
  nothing to load).

The two-call `dbsp_save()`/`dbsp_load()` contract still works exactly as
before and stays useful for named/JSON-file forms and manual snapshots;
auto-persist just means the default zero-arg round trip is no longer
something a caller has to remember.

Turn auto-persist off for bulk-load workflows the same way as auto-sync —
`dbsp_autopersist(false)` before, `(true)` after — to skip the save/load
overhead entirely.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_autopersist(true);   -- Enable (default)
SELECT * FROM dbsp_autopersist(false);  -- Disable
SELECT * FROM dbsp_autopersist();       -- Query status
```

### dbsp_autopersist_interval(n)

Piggyback a circuit-state checkpoint every `n` commits (counted across
`dbsp_sync`-driven propagation), so a crash between clean shutdowns loses
at most `n` commits of operator state. **Default 0 (off)** — the
underlying data is never at risk either way (base tables are
DuckDB-durable, and a stale checkpoint fails its watermark check and
falls back to a full rebuild on load).

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_autopersist_interval(100);  -- checkpoint every 100 commits
SELECT * FROM dbsp_autopersist_interval(0);    -- off
SELECT * FROM dbsp_autopersist_interval();     -- query the current interval
```

### dbsp_lazy_restore(enable)

Toggle lazy per-view checkpoint restore (D-lazy) — **ON by default**: a
`dbsp_load()` circuit-state checkpoint fast path cold-creates every
covered view but decodes each one's node/sink blobs on first need instead
of eagerly, so reopen returns without paying every view's blob-decode
cost. The first `dbsp_query()`, incoming delta, or other read of a
still-pending view's live state decodes it transparently — the query or
delta still returns/applies the exact same result, just with the decode
cost deferred to when it's actually needed. A checkpointed view never
touched between reopen and the next `dbsp_save()` is re-saved verbatim
(no decode at all).

One deliberate exception to "decodes transparently on first read": `dbsp_views()`
reports a pending view's row count from the checkpoint's stashed metadata
without decoding it (see `dbsp_views()` above) — it enumerates every view,
so realizing there would eagerly decode everything on the first call.

`dbsp_load()`'s report string counts views left pending separately from
"sources deferred" (D3c table baselines) and "from checkpoint":

```
Loaded views from _dbsp_views (43 views, 43 from checkpoint, 0 sources
deferred, 43 pending lazy restore)
```

Turn lazy restore off for bulk benchmarks or when debugging a restore
issue and you want every view's state visibly live immediately after
`dbsp_load()`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_lazy_restore(true);   -- Enable (default)
SELECT * FROM dbsp_lazy_restore(false);  -- Disable (eager, pre-D-lazy behavior)
SELECT * FROM dbsp_lazy_restore();       -- Query status
```

### dbsp_stats()

Sync-path observability counters, for monitoring which ingestion path
serves a workload:

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_stats();
-- metric                  | value
-- captured_delta_syncs    | 1042   -- O(Δ) captured applies (per table)
-- scan_syncs              | 3      -- scan-and-diff fallbacks
-- capture_guard_fallbacks | 0      -- guard-rejected captures (loud)
-- commit_seq              | 1045   -- monotonic baseline mutations
-- tracked_tables          | 4
```

### dbsp_parallel(enable)

Toggle parallel execution (default off): multi-table syncs scan on
threads, views at the same dependency level update concurrently during
propagation, and large residual-free inner-join probe passes split
across cores.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_parallel(true);
```

### dbsp_mv_tables(enable)

Disk-backed MV results (bounded-RAM Phase 1b, default off): every registered
view mirrors its result into a `__mv_<view>` table in the same database —
backfilled on enable and at view creation, then kept in sync with one
internal transaction per propagation pass. `__dbsp_mv_meta(view_name,
commit_seq)` records the watermark of each table's last write. Backing
tables are ordinary tables: durable across reopen and readable without any
DBSP state. Disabling stops mirroring and leaves the tables stale.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_mv_tables(true);
```

Per-commit apply is DELETE (retractions) + INSERT (additions) via a staged
temp table; any delta weight beyond ±1 rebuilds the table from its own
current rows + the delta.

**Table-backed reads (Phase 1c)**: once a view's table is written, the sink
stops integrating — the RAM result is dropped and the __mv_ table IS the
result. `dbsp_query`, create-time replay of view sources, and shared-
arrangement backfill all stream from the table; checkpoints save operator
state only (rows are already durable). Enable is idempotent (table
functions can be bound twice per statement — a second backfill would run
after the results were dropped). Disabling schedules a full view rebuild so
sinks reintegrate in RAM.

### dbsp_realize(view_name)

Realize one pending (lazy-restored) view's circuit state now instead of on
first touch. Returns `realized` (whether it WAS pending) and `state_bytes`
(the view's resident state after realization) — sum the latter to warm
within a RAM budget and leave the tail lazy.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_realize('customer_totals');
```

### dbsp_wait_teardown()

Wait (bounded, ~30s max) for detached close-time teardown threads. Call from
a throwaway connection after closing your last real connection and before
process exit — exiting during the detached teardown segfaults in static
destructors. Pair with an explicit `dbsp_save()` before the final close so
the teardown has no SQL left to run.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_wait_teardown();
```

### dbsp_spill(enable)

Toggle disk-backed state (default off): tracked-table baselines, join
indexes (shared and local), top-K sort windows, and oversized holistic
aggregate groups move to disk record logs; RAM keeps compact digest
indexes and hot-bucket caches. Trades sync CPU (row serialization) for
bounded memory. Live state migrates both directions on toggle.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_spill(true);
```

## Error Handling

duckDBSP uses a structured error code system (DBSP-Exxx) that provides:

- **Error codes** in format `DBSP-E{category}{number}` (e.g., DBSP-E101)
- **Clear descriptions** of what went wrong
- **SQL highlighting** with position markers (^) showing exactly where the error occurred
- **Workarounds** suggesting alternative approaches for unsupported features
- **Documentation links** to detailed error explanations

### Error Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **E1xx** | Unsupported SQL | E110 (plan operator not supported) |
| **E2xx** | Validation errors (invalid input) | E201 (Invalid identifier) |
| **E3xx** | Runtime errors (execution failures) | E301 (View update failed) |
| **E4xx** | Resource errors (limits exceeded) | E401 (Too many views) |
| **E5xx** | Persistence errors (I/O failures) | E501 (Load failed) |

### Example Error

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_create_view('high_orders',
    'SELECT customer, SUM(amt) FROM orders GROUP BY customer HAVING SUM(amt) > 1000');

-- Error:
-- DBSP-E101: HAVING clause in GROUP BY
--
-- SQL:
-- SELECT customer, SUM(amt) FROM orders GROUP BY customer HAVING SUM(amt) > 1000
--                                                          ^
--
-- Workaround:
-- Use a nested view: create a view with GROUP BY, then create another view
-- with WHERE clause to filter the aggregated results. Tracked in TODO #3.
--
-- Documentation: docs/errors/E1xx/DBSP-E101.md
```

### Legacy Error Messages

Some operations still return simple error strings:

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbsp_query('nonexistent');
-- Throws: InvalidInputException("View not found: nonexistent")
```
